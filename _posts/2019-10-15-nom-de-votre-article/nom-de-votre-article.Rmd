He thinks that it could have a good impact on the ecosystem. This idea is one part of others ideas like diversifying forests. He refers at other re-introductions in others countries. At Yellowstone in 1995, the re-introduction of wolves has allowed to limit the deer population. It allows ecological balance and biodiversity. Minister for Arts is not agree with this. She thinks that the re-introductions of a predator who had disappeared for 250 years could undermine the various conservation programms and have damage to farming.
