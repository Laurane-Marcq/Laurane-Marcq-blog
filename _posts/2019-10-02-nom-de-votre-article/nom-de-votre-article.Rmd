| Procedure/what was examined? | 20,000 trees will be planted in the first reserve naturelle in UK next year. It's the continuity of regeneration efforts. Scottish Natural Heritage will extend this programm at Beinn Eighe, a natural reserve. There is a rest of ancient Caledonian pine who has planted 800,00 differents trees. SNH promotes the natural regeneration with the expansion of forests. The forests capture 30,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases par years. Stuart Macquarrie says that the plantation of trees will allow the fight against climate change, enhance the biodiversity of natural reserves and restore ecosystem habitats. The forest expanson is crucial to limit the climate change.  |
