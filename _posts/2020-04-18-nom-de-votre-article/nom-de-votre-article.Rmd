In conclusion, the conservation of natural reserves can be achieved by the reintroduction of endangered species. It is a way of restoring belance.
In addition, the reintroduction of one specie into an ecosystem does not only have positives consequences on that specie. This has also positives consequences for a set of other species.
However, to reintroduce a species, several conditions must be met. This must not be done in any way. 
However, the conservation of an ecosystems is a processus who needs times and it takes a lot of efforts from many people. Indeed, an ecosystem is really fragile and a little thing, by example, the accidental arrival of a species that is not part of the environment, can have disastrous consequences.
